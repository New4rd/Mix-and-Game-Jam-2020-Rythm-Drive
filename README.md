# Mix and Game Jam (2020): Rythm'Drive!

That depository is the source code for my participation to the Mix and Game Jam (2020). In accordance with the conditions of participation to the jam, all of the coding assets where made during in 48 hours, from November 13 to 15. The game was made using Unity 2020.1.4f1.

## The game

The player is controlling a car rolling along an infinite road, and has to avoid other cars coming into his direction. The rythm to spawn and move the enemies is based on the music running in the background. If the player moves at the good timing, he will get bonus points.
The theme of the jam was "Mixing Genres", so I choosed to mix a driving car gameplay in a Game&Watch spirit, with the principle of rythm games.
